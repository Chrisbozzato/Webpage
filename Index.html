      <h2>I love video games.</h2>
          <p1>This is a common thing for younger people, so whatever. I loved video games yes, and just like anyone I thought they just existed somehow when I was younger.  At some point I realised that it was someones job to make them, and I found that as a shock, and a calling.  I can't really do art, and stories aren't a strong suit of mine either, so I had decided that what I wanted to do was code them, and so here I am.

      <h3>Persistence is the key.</h3>
      <p2>For a long time now I have been doing Taekwondo, and in doing so learned life skills.  One of them is very important for this kind of thing, and the more I push it the better it gets, that thing being perserverance.  This kind of stuff is hard, errors occur for seemingly no reason, and you just can't get it to work, because of that perserverance is incredibly important and I am glad I managed to learn it from a young age.</p2>
